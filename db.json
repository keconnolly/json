      around Rochedale State Primary School 	18th March, 2019-07-20*iii.	Child Care LocationPreamble:Although  
      there is no Public Notice anywhere on the boundary of the site for the proposed Child Care Centre on 21/7/2019, 
      it has been made public on the “Your Neighbour Site”  online at http://www.yourneighbourhood.com.au/rochedale-road-rochedale/       
		Because of this I am uncertain if objections can be made  against the proposal at this time 
      but, to be sure, have prepared and am lodging this document of objection.  Should lodgement of my objection  at this time not be acceptable or in accordance with Council Policy, please advise me of what is required  by email or letter .  Although  I believe that the Child Care proposal has many flaws, this objection is confined to  two (2)  grounds, each  then supported by its own relevant facts and circumstances.  These grounds are:A.	The present traffic congestion situation is continuing to  deteriorate, and traffic from this proposal will only exacerbate problems. That this is a problem, has previously brought to the attention of the Lord Mayor, Cr Adrian Schrinner"
